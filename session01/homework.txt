calculate your age in seconds
calculate the age 68  69 in seconds


sum reciprocals 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/100 = 5.18

do it backwards 1/100 + 1/99 + ... + 1/1 = 5.18
print the difference

Mystery sum:
s = 1/(1*1) + 1/(2*2) + 1/(3*3) + ...
s = 1.64???????

sqrt(s*6)

Compute to maximum accuracy you can get for float.



Make a circular ball that travels around the edge of the window
(0,0) --> (599,0) --> (599,599) --> (0,599) --> (0,0)

draw a grid of lines 8x8 (use loops)
